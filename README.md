This is a MERN stack project to provide digital solution to Contingency Fund Youth Association Barkangango(आकस्मिक निधि युवा संस्था बरकनगांगो).
This also includes one expo project which is used to build mobile application.

## Considerations

- There are three types of role for users:
    - Super Admin: To manage admins and bulk screenshots
    - Admin: To manage members and monthly screenshot verifications
    - Member: All users who will contribute to the Association and get benefitted when required

## Features


## TODO

- Use Redux to manage state for upload and anything else.
