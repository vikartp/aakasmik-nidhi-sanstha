# üéØ Expo Share Intent Integration Guide

## ‚úÖ What We've Implemented

### 1. **Package Installation**
- ‚úÖ `expo-share-intent@4.1.2` - Latest stable version for Expo SDK 53
- ‚úÖ `patch-package` - For applying required patches
- ‚úÖ `expo-linking` - Already installed (required dependency)

### 2. **Configuration in app.json**
```json
{
  "plugins": [
    "expo-router",
    [
      "expo-share-intent",
      {
        "iosActivationRules": {
          "NSExtensionActivationSupportsImageWithMaxCount": 5,
          "NSExtensionActivationSupportsMovieWithMaxCount": 3
        },
        "androidIntentFilters": ["image/*", "video/*"],
        "androidMultiIntentFilters": ["image/*", "video/*"]
      }
    ],
    // ... other plugins
  ]
}
```

### 3. **Context Provider Setup**
- ‚úÖ `ShareIntentContext.tsx` - Wraps expo-share-intent functionality
- ‚úÖ Added to root layout (`_layout.tsx`) 
- ‚úÖ Provides app-wide access to shared content

### 4. **Share Intent Handler Component**
- ‚úÖ `ShareIntentHandler.tsx` - Handles shared images automatically
- ‚úÖ Filters for image files only
- ‚úÖ Shows confirmation dialog before upload
- ‚úÖ Integrates with existing upload API
- ‚úÖ Added to DashboardScreen

### 5. **Postinstall Script**
- ‚úÖ Added to package.json for automatic patch application

## üéØ How It Works

### **User Flow:**
1. **User shares image from Gallery/Camera app**
2. **Your app appears in share options**
3. **User selects your app**
4. **App opens with shared image**
5. **ShareIntentHandler detects the shared content**
6. **Shows confirmation dialog**
7. **Uploads to your backend as payment screenshot**

### **Technical Flow:**
```
Other App ‚Üí Share ‚Üí Your App ‚Üí ShareIntentProvider ‚Üí 
ShareIntentHandler ‚Üí API Upload ‚Üí Success Notification
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Issue: XCode Patch

### **Problem:**
The expo-share-intent package requires a patch for the xcode npm package, but the patch is failing to apply.

### **Why This Happens:**
- The patch was created for a specific version of the xcode package
- Different versions may have slightly different code structure
- This only affects iOS builds

### **Solutions:**

#### **Option 1: Use Development Build (Recommended for Testing)**
```bash
# Skip the patch for now and test on Android first
expo prebuild --platform android
expo run:android
```

#### **Option 2: Manual Patch Creation**
If you need iOS support immediately:
1. Find the exact issue in `node_modules/xcode/lib/pbxProject.js`
2. Create a custom patch with `npx patch-package xcode`

#### **Option 3: Use EAS Build**
EAS Build handles patches automatically and may resolve the issue:
```bash
eas build --platform all
```

## üöÄ Testing Steps

### **Android Testing (Should Work Now):**
1. **Build for Android:**
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --platform android --clean
   expo run:android
   ```

2. **Test Share Intent:**
   - Open Gallery app on Android
   - Select an image
   - Tap Share
   - Look for your app "anidhi" in share options
   - Tap your app
   - Should open your app with upload dialog

### **iOS Testing (After Patch Resolution):**
1. **Build for iOS:**
   ```bash
   expo prebuild --platform ios --clean
   expo run:ios
   ```

2. **Test Share Intent:**
   - Open Photos app on iOS
   - Select an image  
   - Tap Share
   - Look for your app in share sheet
   - Tap your app
   - Should open your app with upload dialog

## üì± Share Intent Configuration Details

### **What Your App Accepts:**
- **Images**: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP, etc.
- **Videos**: MP4, MOV, etc.
- **Multiple files**: Up to 5 images, 3 videos

### **Supported Share Sources:**
- Gallery/Photos apps
- Camera apps
- Screenshot tools
- Other apps sharing images/videos
- WhatsApp, Telegram (save image then share)
- Web browsers (save image then share)

### **Your App Will Appear In:**
- Android: "Share via" menu
- iOS: Share sheet
- As "anidhi" or your app display name

## üîß Code Structure

### **Files Added/Modified:**
1. **`context/ShareIntentContext.tsx`** - Share intent state management
2. **`components/ShareIntentHandler.tsx`** - UI for handling shared content  
3. **`app/_layout.tsx`** - Added ShareIntentProvider
4. **`components/DashboardScreen.tsx`** - Integrated share handler
5. **`app.json`** - Added expo-share-intent plugin configuration
6. **`package.json`** - Added postinstall script
7. **`patches/xcode+3.0.1.patch`** - Required patch file

### **Integration Points:**
- Uses existing API service (`services/api.ts`)
- Uses existing upload function (`uploadScreenshot`)
- Integrated with existing authentication
- Uses existing UI components (ThemedView, ThemedText)

## üéâ Expected User Experience

### **Before (Current State):**
- User has to manually open your app
- Navigate to upload screen  
- Tap "Select Screenshot"
- Choose from gallery
- Upload

### **After (With Share Intent):**
- User sees payment screenshot in Gallery
- Taps Share ‚Üí Your App
- **Instant upload dialog appears**
- One tap to upload
- **Much faster workflow!**

## üîß Next Steps

1. **Test Android first** (should work without patch issues)
2. **Resolve iOS patch issue** if needed
3. **Test with various image sources**
4. **Fine-tune user experience**
5. **Deploy to production**

## üÜò Troubleshooting

### **If Share Intent Doesn't Appear:**
- Ensure app is installed properly (not Expo Go)
- Check app.json configuration
- Verify prebuild completed successfully
- Try with different image sources

### **If Upload Fails:**
- Check network connectivity
- Verify API endpoints are working
- Check authentication state
- Look for error messages in ShareIntentHandler

### **If App Crashes:**
- Check Metro/console logs
- Verify all dependencies are installed
- Ensure patch was applied correctly

Your app is now **90% ready** for share intent functionality! The main remaining task is resolving the xcode patch issue for iOS builds.
